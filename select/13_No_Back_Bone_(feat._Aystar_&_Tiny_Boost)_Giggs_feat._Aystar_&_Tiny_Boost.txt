Mhh
Yeah (leggo)

Yeah, uh
What the fuck is all that gossip 'bout?
It wasn't us if we ain't shoot him up or chop him down
Nah, that ain't my bitch, that's just a toss around
I got the streets, though, I'm covering a lot of ground
I'm takin' over, yeah, running to that bank
And I can't take it slower, came up out the rock
Like my name was Hova, mummy raised a king
Peckham made a soldier, yeah this thing is ours
Like La Cosa Nostra, Coca Cola, baking soda
Ah, put the magic in, that's Hocus Pocus
Niggas sending shots and I don't even notice
True, they're babies to me, I just wipe their noses
Pull up with a stick and just do the Moses
Put a parting through your wig like he did the ocean, uh
My bad, I meant the sea
If you ask about mе, I'm everything I'm meant to bе
My darg in that jammy got a quarter century
My other darg in that trap, he got a quarter of them kis, ah
All I do is talk about the streets
That rat came home and he got corn within a week
Shh, ah, yeah, shouldn't even speak
Very short fuse with a very long reach
All I do is win, I've had a very long streak
Ain't no fillin' my shoes with them feet
Me and you ain't size, nigga, don't know who lied to ya
I can see the bitch behind that twinkle in your eye, nigga
Never been my guy if I ain't done that do or die with ya
I won't say slatt but for that pack you get slimed, nigga
In the bin, no strap, just an ice picker, yeah
And I got money on my mind, nigga
Hundred racks, straight cash, that's a nice figure, ah
I'm still gang, I ain't no side switcher

Niggas switchin' sides, they ain't got no backbone
Lil' nigga, I'm in the bits with a bulldog with no backbone
That phone's rang twice, nigga don't be callin' that no traphone
See me lying down with a MAC prone, if it's beef, you don't want that smoke
Get dragged in a Jeep, left in the street, all bloody and weak
It's bloody and peak, if I pull up with the something with buttons and squeeze
Yeah, got you duckin' from sweets
Now I'm duckin' from police, on the run from the beef

Won't forget it
Niggas out here so pathetic
Thinkin' that it's copasetic
Boxed in like a sandwich, niggas gon' baguette it
Glocks out and 'em ballys, niggas gon' regret it
Box him, chicken sandwich, niggas gon' fillet it, yeah
Oh, you want a challenge? Niggas known to set it
Keys like DJ Khaled, niggas known to get it
Niggas so invalid and they owe me credit
Niggas picking sides and they flippin' biased
Man clipped up your ride and we slit the tires
And man picked up my star and I'm sick and tired
Just zipped my flies, I'm the flippin' flyest
Niggas tellin' lies and they quick to buy it
Niggas gonna die 'cause they quick to try it, yeah
Show them hella times but their clique deny it
Shot at man in June, he got pitched July-ish
Straight up, had to bun him
I know that it's sad but nigga had it coming
Even when it's winter, niggas brang the sun in
Hundred miles of runnin', had to bash his skull in
Even when it's boring, niggas add some fun in
Finger in her pussy and my thumb in
Nigga, I'm the dumbest, brang my gun in
They say Hollow's gully and they love him
Yeah, lightest talkin'
Man ain't talkin' shorts but mandem tried to short him
I don't like to talk, just stick my knife and fork in
Niggas talkin' powers like they're mighty-morphin'
Niggas get it right, I want the nicest portion
Who's these little f–s that they like endorsing?
Talkin' porky pies, I got the right to pork him
Man, that pussy good, that get the right endorphins

Niggas switchin' sides, they ain't got no backbone
Lil' nigga, I'm in the bits with a bulldog with no backbone
That phone's rang twice, nigga don't be callin' that no traphone
See me lying down with a MAC prone, if it's beef, you don't want that smoke
Get dragged in a Jeep, left in the street, all bloody and weak
It's bloody and peak, if I pull up with the something with buttons and squeeze
Yeah, got you duckin' from sweets
Now I'm duckin' from police, on the run from the beef (skrrt)
