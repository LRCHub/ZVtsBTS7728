Swimming in the music
To the place where I should be
I don't need to breath
in this water
And I feel like I'm dissolving
I can go anywhere
Go faster that the
speed of sound
Be stronger than the cruelties
Gotta go before the lights
freeze up
Cause death is the Cousin of
me and you
Can't run away
Swimming in the music
To the place where I should be
I don't need to breath
in this water
And I feel like I'm dissolving
I can go anywhere
Go faster that the
speed of sound
Be stronger than the cruelties
Gotta go before the lights
freeze up
Cause death is the Cousin of me
Somebody is calling my name
With greedy voice,
don't hear that
Gotta go before the lights
freeze up
Cause death is the Cousin of
me and you
Forget me nots
They are blooming in the rain
Singing the song I heard before
Go faster that the
speed of sound
Be stronger than the cruelties
Gotta go before the lights
freeze up
Cause death is the Cousin of me
Somebody is calling my name
With greedy voice,
don't hear that
Gotta go before the lights
freeze up
Cause death is the Cousin of
me and you
me and you
Can't run away
