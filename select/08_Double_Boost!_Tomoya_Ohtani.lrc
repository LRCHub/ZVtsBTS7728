[00:05.13] Together, we can show the world what we can do
[00:08.02] You are next to me and I'm next to you
[00:10.27] Push me on through until the battle's won
[00:30.77] 
[00:14.59] No one's gonna give a thing to us
[00:16.80] Into each other we put our trust
[00:19.11] Standing united, after the fight
